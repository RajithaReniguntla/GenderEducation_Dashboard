# Education & Gender Impact: Norway, India, and New Zealand

This Power BI project explores how education influences gender-related outcomes in three culturally and economically distinct countries: **Norway**, **India**, and **New Zealand**.

## Purpose of Visualization
This dashboard's key purpose is to provide a **comparative analysis** on gender dynamics in **education and employment** across Norway, India, and New Zealand.

Through visualizing key indicators such as:
- Educational attainment (Bachelors / Masters)
- Labor force participation rates
- Unemployment rates
- Tertiary graduation ratios

The dashboard offers an insightful view into **gender disparities** in education and how these disparities translate into **employment opportunities over a decade (2011–2020)**.

While Norway and New Zealand are developed economies with similar population sizes and GDP, India presents a contrasting picture. As a rapidly developing economy, India faces greater challenges in closing the gender gap in both education and workforce participation.

This dashboard serves as a **valuable tool for policymakers**, enabling them to assess how educational investments can impact labor market dynamics and support gender-balanced employment. The insights can help drive **targeted policies** and guide **resource allocation** strategies.

## Key Insights
- Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to exhibit better gender balance in employment.
- In Norway, despite a higher proportion of female tertiary graduates, women still lag behind men in labor force participation marginally.
- Labor force participation among women remains lowest in India, and slightly on the decreasing trend in the recent years.
- Norway and New Zealand show more consistent employment equality trends over time.
